What is AWS : AWS stands for Amazon Web Services and it is a cloud computing platform that offers a wide array of services including computing, storage, databases and more.

AWS History : 

Launched in 2002

Launched Publicly with SQS (Simple Queue Service)

2006 -> Relaunched publicly with SQS, S3 & EC2

2007 -> Launched in Europe


What is Cloud Computing :- Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications and other IT resources.

Deployment models of the cloud :- 

Private cloud :- Cloud Services used by a single organization not exposed to the public is called Private cloud.

An org can have complete control on the cloud
Security for sensitive applications
Meet specific business needs

Eg:- Rackspace

Public cloud :- Cloud resources owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider delivered over the internet.

Eg:- Google cloud, AWS, Azure

Hybrid cloud :- Keeping some servers on premises and extending some capabilities to the cloud.

Control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure.
Flexibility and cost effectiveness of the public cloud.

Five characteristics of Cloud Computing :- 

On-demand self service :- 
Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider.

Broad network access :- 
Resources available over the internet and can be accessed by diverse client platforms 

Multi-tenancy and resource pooling :- Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy

Rapid Elasticity and scalability :- Quickly and easily scale based on the demand.

Measured service :- Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used 

Six Advantages of Cloud Computing :- 

Trade capital expense (CAPEX) for operational expense (OPEX)
                   → Pay On-Demand: don’t own hardware
                   → Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)

Benefit from massive economies of scale
                   →  Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale 

Stop guessing capacity
                   → Scale based on actual measured usage 

Increase speed and agility

Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers

Go global in minutes: leverage the AWS global infrastructure

Problems solved by the Cloud :- 

Flexibility :- Change resource types when needed 

Cost - Effectiveness :- pay as you go, for what you use.

Scalability: accommodate larger loads by making hardware stronger or adding additional nodes

Elasticity :- ability to scale out and scale-in when needed 

High-availability and fault-tolerance: build across data centers

Agility: rapidly develop, test and launch software applications





Types of Cloud Computing :- 

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a business model that delivers IT infrastructure like compute, storage, and network resources on a pay-as-you-go basis over the internet.


Eg :- EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud), GCP, Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode


Platform as a service(Paas) 
Removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure. 
Focus on the deployment and management of your application.
                             
                              (or)
Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a complete cloud environment that includes everything developers need to build, run, and manage applications—from servers and operating systems to all the networking, storage, middleware, tools, and more


Eg:- Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku, Google App Engine (GCP), Windows Azure (Microsoft)


Software as a service (SaaS) 


Completed product that is run and managed by the service provider
                                      (or)
Software as a service (or SaaS) is a way of delivering applications over the Internet—as a service. Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management.



Pricing of the Cloud :- 
AWS has 3 pricing fundamentals, following the pay-as-you-go pricing model 


Compute:  Pay for compute time 


Storage: Pay for data stored in the Cloud


Data transfer OUT of the Cloud: Data transfer IN is free


Solves the expensive issue of traditional IT


AWS Global Infrastructure :- 


AWS Regions 


AWS Availability Zones 


AWS Data Centers 


AWS Edge Locations / Points of Presence


AWS Regions :- 


AWS has regions all over the world 


A region is a cluster of data centers 


Most AWS services are region-scoped 


How to choose an AWS Region?


Compliance with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission 


Proximity to customers: reduced latency 


Available services within a Region: new services and new features aren’t available in every Region 


Pricing: pricing varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page
 AWS Availability Zones :- 


Each region has many availability zones (usually 3, min is 3, max is 6)


Each availability zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity


They’re separate from each other, so that they’re isolated from disasters


They’re connected with high bandwidth, ultra-low latency networking


AWS Global Services :- 


Identity and Access Management (IAM) 


Route 53 (DNS service) 


CloudFront (Content Delivery Network) 


WAF (Web Application Firewall)


Most AWS services are Region-scoped:


Amazon EC2 (Infrastructure as a Service)


Elastic Beanstalk (Platform as a Service) 


Lambda (Function as a Service) 


Rekognition (Software as a Service)
