# AWS-Certified-Cloud-Developer-Certification


Welcome to my repository where I document my learnings and notes from the Ultimate AWS Certified Developer - Associate 2025 (DVA-C02) course by Stephane Maarek on Udemy.

In this repository, I will be sharing key concepts, tips, and important takeaways from the course, which is designed to help you prepare for the AWS Certified Developer - Associate exam. The course provides in-depth coverage of AWS services, best practices, and hands-on experience, all of which I will summarize here for easy reference.
